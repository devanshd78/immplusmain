								<li class="list-item">Any term referring to a natural person shall also apply to an
									artificial person. References to gender include all genders, and singular terms
									encompass plural forms (and vice versa).</li>
								<li class="list-item">Headings and bold formatting in these T&Cs are for ease of
									reference only and should not affect their interpretation.</li>
								<li class="list-item">The phrase "including," when followed by specific examples, should
									not be interpreted as limiting the broader meaning of the preceding general terms.

								<li class="list-item">The principle that a contract should be interpreted against the
									party that drafted it does not apply here.</li>
								<li class="list-item">References to any clause, article, section, or schedule pertain to
									the relevant part of these T&Cs, unless otherwise specified.</li>
							</ul>

							<h6 class="h6-lg">ONBOARDING AND DELIVERY SERVICES</h6>

							<p>To be onboarded onto the Immpllus Delivery Partner (DP) Platform for Delivery Services,
								the Delivery Partner may be required to pay a one-time onboarding fee, the amount of
								which will be determined by Immpllus and communicated to the Delivery Partner
								("Onboarding Fee"). This fee will be paid to the account or in the manner specified by
								Immpllus prior to onboarding. Additionally, the Delivery Partner may also be responsible
								for fees related to training and support services provided by Immpllus.</p>

							<p>The Delivery Partner(s) shall have access to the Immpllus DP Platform at all times unless
								there is a technical glitch or if the Immpllus DP Platform is being updated.</p>

							<p>The Delivery Partner must create a login ID on the Immpllus DP Platform to provide
								Delivery Services. The Delivery Partner acknowledges that their login credentials,
								including the password, are confidential and must not be shared with any third party
								without prior written consent from Immpllus. Any misuse of these credentials will be the
								sole responsibility of the Delivery Partner and may result in the suspension of the
								login ID.</p>

							<p>The Delivery Partner is not obligated to be available on the Immpllus DP Platform for a
								minimum number of hours or days. They can choose, at their discretion, to either (i) log
								in to the Immpllus DP Platform whenever they wish for any duration, or (ii) book slots
								in advance, during which they must remain logged in for the entirety of the booked slot.
							</p>

							<p>If a Delivery Partner books a slot but fails to log in, it may negatively affect their
								performance metrics. Additionally, if a Delivery Partner cancels a booked slot, they
								will be required to pay a cancellation fee as determined by Immpllus, which may be
								deducted from their payout.</p>

							<p>In addition to the Delivery Partner Fee(s), Immpllus may pay an availability fee to the
								Delivery Partner(s) for being available on the Immpllus DP Platform to undertake
								Delivery Services ("Availability Fee").</p>

							<p>The Delivery Partner(s) confirm and acknowledge that by logging-in on the Immpllus DP
								Platform, the Delivery Partner agrees to be tracked via GPS-enabled tracking technology
								for the duration while the Delivery Partner(s) is logged-in to the Immpllus DP Platform
								for enabling Immpllus to share this information with Customer(s) on a real-time basis
								for tracking the status of their orders.</p>

							<p>Immpllus shall not supervise the actions and conduct of the Delivery Partner(s) unless
								there is a complaint made against the Delivery Partner(s) or they are in violation of
								these T&Cs while rendering Delivery Services.</p>

							<p>The Delivery Partner(s) shall attempt to collect and deliver the order(s) without any
								unwarranted delay. In the event there is a delay in delivery, the Delivery Partner(s)
								will inform the Store Manager(s) and/or Immpllus designated representative providing the
								reason for such delay to enable Immpllus to communicate the status of the order to the
								Customer(s).</p>

							<p>If the order placed by the Customer(s) remains undelivered or is canceled for any reason
								attributable to the Delivery Partner(s), the Delivery Partner(s) will inform the Store
								Manager(s) and/or Immpllus designated representative providing the reason for such order
								being undelivered or canceled to enable Immpllus to communicate such reason to the
								Customer(s).</p>

							<p>All queries and questions raised by the Delivery Partner(s), including but not limited to
								how to collect an order from the outlet of a Dark Store, directions for the delivery
								address, manner to store the order while in transit, shall be directed to the Store
								Manager of the designated Dark Stores.</p>

							<p>The Delivery Partner(s) may be required to undergo training, where the Delivery
								Partner(s) will be shown how to use the Immpllus DP Platform, including booking of Slots
								along with other compliances and performance parameters which are required to be adhered
								to by the Delivery Partner(s).</p>

							<p>In case Delivery Partner(s) require any assistance, clarification and/or help with regard

								Slots, medal tiers, payouts, and/or other information, then the Delivery Partner(s) may

								same against the payouts required to be made by Immplus to the Delivery Partner(s) for

							<p>The Delivery Partner(s) agrees and acknowledges that in case Immplus is made aware that a

								Clause 10 of these T&Cs.</p>

							<p>At no time whatsoever shall the Delivery Partner(s) tamper, damage, open, or do anything

								of such person to whom the delivery is delegated, including any civil or criminal
								liability.</p>

							<p>The Delivery Partner(s) shall return the ordered items to the Dark Store(s) in the event
